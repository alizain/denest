The new government, the Republic of China was founded under Sun Yat-sen and his Revolutionary Alliance (predecessor of Kuomingtang aka the Nationalist Party (KMT)) and sought to establish a constitutional democratic republic. However, in 1915, a warlord and politician who had aided Yat-sen, and had a pivotal role in forcing Emperor Pu Yi (the famous puppet emperor) to abdicate, Yuan Shikai, turned on the KMT and declared himself the new emperor. Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan and later founded the G/Kuomingtang (KMT/GMT). \n\nYuan Shikai meanwhile lost his power in 1916 due to widespread opposition and China devolved into a feudal state where territories were controlled by a mix of colonial powers and local Chinese warlords.\n\nOne year after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, Chiang Kai-shek took control of the KMT and began the Northern Expedition to subjugate the warlords and begin the goal of reunifying China as a one-party state and eventually succeeded doing so with notable exceptions such as Manchuria, which was occupied by the Japanese.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1921, the Communist Party of China (CCP) was founded as an insurgency chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao and began gaining power and influence among both the common people and within KMT's own ranks due to disillusionment with corruption, elitism, and brutality in the KMT bureaucracy, a trend that would continue to the end of the civil war and greatly empower the CCP. In addition, there was a perception that the KMT were more concerned with repelling the CCP than Japanese aggression. The often-referenced Long March occured around then, where the KMT began a huge military campaign against the CPC, forcing them to retreat to the mountain, and where less than 10% of the CCP army was cited to have survived.\n\nIn 1931, the Xi'an Incident occured, where the CPC convinces KMT official Zhang Xueliang to take Chiang Kai-Shek hostage and force him to agree with the CPC to initiate total war against the Japanese, independently and not without clashes in the process. The contribution of the KMT is considered notably higher than that of the CPC.\n\nIn 1945, the Japanese surrendered, marking the end of WWII in the Asia-Pacific Theater, and in 1946, a full civil war erupted between KMT and CCP. By 1949, the CCP had full control of the mainland and the KMT retreated to Formosa, now known as Taiwan, and established ROC there (and gave the natives the boot).

It might add a few weeks to bombing campaign before you landed troops, but if China just wanted to invade, and could do it free of repercussions, they could do it quickly. It&amp;#39;s like if a small militia took over a town in Iowa and had a huge stockpile of guns and some heavy artillery. If the US decided to put them down and sent a Marine regiment to do it, the Marines would take it in a day. The weapons don&amp;#39;t matter to anyone but the companies building them, and to the Taiwanese who get the sense of security. China don&amp;#39;t give a fuck about that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The real thing securing the safety of Taiwan in the implication that the US and the world in general would be very angry with the Chinese. Yes we don&amp;#39;t recognize Taiwan officially, but we&amp;#39;ve made it clear not to invade them. The US has enough of a relationship with China, in terms of billions of dollars in trade, that neither China or the US really wants to mess that up over an island off the coast of China. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what you have in the end is a sort of gentlemen&amp;#39;s arrangement. We don&amp;#39;t officially acknowledge the government of Taiwan, and China looks the other way on our obvious business and military relationships. Taiwan remains independent in spite of and because of this. That arrangement only works though if all sides actually understand how it works. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "worldnews", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_daq9gge", "created": 1480774708.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1480745908.0, "ups": 33, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 14, "parent_id": "t1_daq6gb9", "children": ["daqev43", "daq8y93", "daqh04o", "daq88qx", "daq8bl8", "daqh7ld", "daq6kes", "daqfd1a", "daqecoq", "daqe71a"], "name": "t1_daqev43", "id": "daqev43"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "daq6gb9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ploize", "parent_id": "t1_dapyanu", "score": 127, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So I don't understand.
